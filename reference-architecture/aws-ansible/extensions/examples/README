# Extensions
A collection of AWS CloudFormation snippets that can be merged into the main template at runtime.
My use case is to deploy rds instances. Anything you can create with cfn is valid.
Any snippet needs to be a valid cfn json template. Because its merged before being applied to AWS, it has has access to the same AWS Parameters and jinja variables.

**WARNING**
With great power comes great responsibility.
Your snippet will be deep merged at the root level with the default cfn template.
This means its entirely possible for you to overwrite some defaults. This is a bad idea and will lkely end in and incomplete or broken deployment.
The intent is that you use this feature to deploy *additional* aws resources.

If you declare a resource that is already declared in the default template, it will be merged. This means that both values could be present once merging is complete.

To use a snippet add `--custom-template=/PATH/TO/YOUR/SNIPPET.json`
